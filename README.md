# EspressOS

## Project Notes and Direction
* Hobby x86-64 OS Project
* Targets and milestones in todo.wiki
* Currently Compiles in x86-64 OpenBSD (6.2)
* With some changes to the Make files and using yasm for the bootloader this has been compiled in Ubuntu 16.04.4
* Microkernel -	I don't like having to recompile the entire kernel to just to support something like a new filesystem
* LP64
* FUGPL license - To avoid restrictions on code going upstream
